[DoD:S] Incendiary projectiles v1.0
This funny plugin allows you to set other players on fire.
Simply shoot at the opponents with one of the two rocket launchers (Bazooka, Panzerschreck) or with the two machine guns (30cal, MG42).

If you are hit, you will also catch fire!

This plugin also works with bots!
